# Block Evaluator

Enrich raw block data with a "State Delta" object which contains new account values. For example: new account balances, new application states, which assets have been created or deleted, etc.

The block evaluator computes the delta by maintaining a local ledger and evaluating each block locally.

State Delta's are required by some exporters.

## algod requirement

It is sometimes useful, or necessary to re-initialize the local ledger. To expedite that process a direct connection to algod is used.

This is configured by providing one of:
* `algod-data-dir`: this will automatically lookup the algod address and token. This is convenient when algod is installed locally to conduit.
* `algod-addr` and `algod-token`: explicitly provide the algod connection information.

## catchpoint

Fast catchup can be used for Mainnet, Testnet and Betanet. To use, lookup the most recent catchpoint for your network **without going over the desired round**. Use the following links:
* [Mainnet](https://algorand-catchpoints.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/consolidated/mainnet_catchpoints.txt)
* [Testnet](https://algorand-catchpoints.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/consolidated/testnet_catchpoints.txt)
* [Betanet](https://algorand-catchpoints.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/consolidated/betanet_catchpoints.txt)

For example, if you want to get **Mainnet** round `22212765`, you would refer to the Mainnet link above and find:
* `22210000#MZZIOYXYPPGNYRQHROXCPILIWIMQQRN7ZNLQJVM2QVSKT3QX6O4A`
