# Request For Comment (RFC) Template

This RFC template is a suggestion for how contributors can structure project proposals in order to establish understanding,
and foster productive discussion. You may choose to use any of this structure as you see fit for your purposes.

- Contribution Name:
- Implementation Owner:
- RFC PR: [algorand/indexer#????](https://github.com/algorand/indexer/pull/????)

## Summary

[summary]: #summary

This section should serve as an abstract, a high level outline of the purpose of the RFC document.

## Problem Statement

[problem-statement]: #problem-statement

The problem statement should situate the RFC within the problem space; why do we need to implement this RFC, and what problems will
go unresolved if we don't?


## Design proposal

[design-proposal]: #design-proposal

The design proposal should offer as much detail as possible--code snippets, diagrams, explanation of problematic areas, etc.
More specific design ideas will generate better feedback, and it is always nice when implementation can be taken directly from the design document.

Subdividing the design section into relevant sub-sections can make it easier to fully address individual problems.

### End State

You should define the desired end state, or completion criteria, of your design. In addition to this, it is important to the
Indexer repository to consider the migration path


### Prior art

[prior-art]: #prior-art

It can be helpful to describe alternative design options that were considered and/or implementations that exist in the wild.
Counter examples or supporting designs which make similar decisions will strengthen arguments for your design.

### Unresolved questions

[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions/FAQs

Noting design questions you do not have the answer is an important way to focus feedback on what you consider the most important topics.

Additionally including some FAQs will preempt repetitive clarifying feedback.
